# streamdeck-build-tools

This repository stores build tools (binaries) used by the [Stream Deck Google Meet plugin](https://github.com/ChrisRegado/streamdeck-googlemeet).

Elgato does not currently provide older versions of the Stream Deck Distribution Tools on their site, so storing a
copy here allows us to control which version of the tools we use in our builds and keep a history of build tools, 
while still keeping third-party binaries outside of the main code repo.

The Distribution Tools come from: https://docs.elgato.com/sdk/plugins/packaging
